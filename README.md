# South Indian recipe advisor
This project is a RAG system that turns my mom's South Indian recipes—dishes like dosa, sambar, idli, rasam, and appam that I grew up eating—into an interactive Q&A bot. Ask questions like "How does Amma make crispy dosa?" or "Ingredients for lemon rasam without garlic?" and get accurate, grounded responses pulled directly from her recipes.

Unique twist: Fine-tuned embeddings on South Indian recipe language (e.g., terms like "urad dal" or "tempering with mustard seeds") for better accuracy. Runs locally on CPU (no cloud, keeps family recipes private).
